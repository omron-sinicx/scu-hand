description: This study proposes SCU-Hand, a soft and reconfigurable end-effector designed to scoop powdered materials from containers of various sizes using a general-purpose robotic arm.
 By deforming a single thin sheet into a conical shape, the SCU-Hand achieves adaptive surface contact without complex sensors or control algorithms, while maintaining the stiffness needed for efficient scooping.
 Experimental results demonstrate that SCU-Hand achieves over 95% scooping performance across different container sizes and granular materials, outperforming conventional rigid tools by up to 20%.

overview: |
  Automating small-scale experiments in materialsscience presents challenges due to the heterogeneous natureof experimental setups. This study introduces the SCU-Hand(Soft Conical Universal Robot Hand), a novel end-effectordesigned to automate the task of scooping powdered samplesfrom various container sizes using a robotic arm. The SCU-Hand employs a flexible, conical structure that adapts to dif-ferent container geometries through deformation, maintainingconsistent contact without complex force sensing or machinelearning-based control methods. Its reconfigurable mechanismallows for size adjustment, enabling efficient scooping fromdiverse container types. By combining soft robotics principleswith a sheet-morphing design, our end-effector achieves highflexibility while retaining the necessary stiffness for effectivepowder manipulation. We detail the design principles, fabri-cation process, and experimental validation of the SCU-Hand.Experimental validation showed that the scooping capacity isabout 20% higher than that of a commercial tool, with ascooping performance of more than 95% for containers ofsizes between 67 mm to 110 mm. This research contributesto laboratory automation by offering a cost-effective, easilyimplementable solution for automating tasks such as materialssynthesis and characterization processes.
